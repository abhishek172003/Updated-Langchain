LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. 
This framework consists of several parts.
LangChain Libraries: The Python and JavaScript libraries. Contains interfaces and integrations for a myriad of components, a basic run time for combining these components into chains and agents, and off-the-shelf implementations of chains and agents.
LangChain Templates: A collection of easily deployable reference architectures for a wide variety of tasks.
LangServe: A library for deploying LangChain chains as a REST API.
LangSmith: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor chains built on any LLM framework and seamlessly integrates with LangChain
